# Description

## Cost Tracker

the purpose of this small project is to create a small but steal realistic project

## Scenario

Anna wants to keep track of her money. To help Anna do this, build a web app that allows her to enter the costs as she makes them,
and show how much it adds up to.

## Requirements
the application should:

- allow the user to add cost items with a category and a comment for what it was
- show all cost items in a list
- show the total sum of transactions
- allow the user to filter transactions by category

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
